                <h2>What is Focus Faux Pas?</h2>
                <p>Focus Faux Pas is a handy bookmarklet designed to help you ensure that the focus appearance of focusable elements on a web page complies with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html" rel="nofollow">Focus Appearance (Level AAA) WCAG Guideline</a>. It checks elements like buttons and links ensuring their focus is as sharp as a tack according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>

                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Focus Faux Pas calculates the minimum and actual focus areas for focusable elements, taking into account style details like outline width and offset. It then provides a visual indicator to show if each element's focus game is up to snuff or needs a little extra love.</p>

                <h2>How to use</h2>

                <p>Drag this link to your browser toolbar: <!-- BOOKMARKLET_PLACEHOLDER --></p>

                <p>Then, when you're on a webpage, click the bookmarklet to activate Focus Faux Pas and see the results!</p>

                <p>To remove the results click the bookmarklet again.</p>

                <h2>What Focus Faux Pas doesn't check... just yet?</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Elements like inputs, selects just yet... need to work on a useful way to display results</li>
                    <li>Colour contrast of the outline</li>
                    <li>Other outline styles (inset, dotted etc)</li>
                    <li>Conformance via other methods to produce an "outline" such and box-shadow</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why did I create this?</h2>

                <p>Focus is one of the simplest things to add to your site to improve its accessibility, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html">Focus Appearance WCAG Guideline</a> is new in WCAG 2.2 but it's a AAA level guideline. Most people lump AAA guidelines in the too-hard basket so this tool helps you check if the focus is of sufficient size to pass the guideline.</p>
