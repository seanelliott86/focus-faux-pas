    <h2>What is Focus Faux Pas?</h2>
    <p>Focus Faux Pas is a handy bookmarklet designed to help developers ensure that the focus appearance of various
        elements on a web page complies with accessibility guidelines. It checks elements like buttons, links, and
        more, making sure they're as sharp as a tack according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>

    <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p>Focus Faux Pas calculates the minimum and actual focus areas for focusable elements, taking into account style
        details like outline width and offset. It then provides a visual indicator to show if each element's focus game
        is up to snuff or needs a little extra love.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>

    <p>Let Focus Faux Pas be your guide to accessibility excellence! Happy coding! üöÄ</p>
